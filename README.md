# grub2-mkconfig-helper-scripts
Grub-mkconfig helper scripts we use are provided by redhat in grub2 package, so far the package name with version is grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.6.x86_64.rpm.
We changed one of the scripts "10_linux" to customize the boot menu entries on Veritas Appliances which are based on Redhat OS.
