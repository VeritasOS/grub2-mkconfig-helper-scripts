# grub2-mkconfig-helper-scripts
Grub2-mkconfig helper scripts are used by utility grub-mkconfig to generate grub configuration file grub.cfg. The scripts what we use are provided by Redhat in grub2 package, so far the package name with version is grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.6.x86_64.rpm. We changed one of the scripts "10_linux" to customize the boot menu entries on Veritas Appliances which are based on Redhat OS.
